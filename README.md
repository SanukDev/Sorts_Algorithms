# Sorting Algorithms 

This repository contains **implementations of sorting algorithms** written in **C and Python**, organized for study, comparison, and academic or practical reference.

The algorithms are implemented in a **didactic and readable way**, focusing on understanding logic, time complexity, and real use cases.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Demonstrate correct implementations of classic sorting algorithms;
- Compare different algorithms in terms of logic and performance;
- Support the study of **data structures and algorithms**;
- Serve as a personal and educational reference for programming students.

##  Implemented Algorithms

### C and Python

The repository includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

| Algorithm | Language | Average Time Complexity |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| Bubble Sort | C / Python | O(n²) |
| Selection Sort | C / Python | O(n²) |
| Insertion Sort | C / Python | O(n²) |
| Merge Sort | C / Python | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort | C / Python | O(n log n) |
| Heap Sort | C / Python | O(n log n) |
| (Others may be added) | | |

> 📌 Time complexity may vary depending on input data and implementation details.
